# On_Device_Machine_Learning_for_Parkinsons

Diagnosis of neuro-degenerative diseases sometimes leads to inaccurate decisions and excessive medical costs. Deep learning models can help with diagnosis of such diseases like Parkinson’s and aid in treating symptoms. This study introduces a novel system that integrates pervasive computing, mobile sensing, and machine learning to classify hand-drawn images and provide diagnostic insights for screening of Parkinson’s disease patients. We carefully design a computational framework that combines data augmentation techniques with optimized convolutional network design for on-device and real-time image classification. We assess the performance of our system using images of Archimedean spirals drawn by hand and demonstrate that the proposed techniques achieve 76% accuracy and can run on an Android smartphone. Our study demonstrate that pervasive computing tools may offer an inexpensive and effective tool for diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.
